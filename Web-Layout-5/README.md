   I am Anish.This Project 5 of the bootcamp. 
    It took me a bit longer about seven hours to code this CSS file but it was much comfortable to code.
    The main problem of this code was the part of image overlaping on text. I learned that position of images 
    and text in a HTML file also matters.

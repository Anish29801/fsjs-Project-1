   I am Anish.This Project 9 of the bootcamp. It was a difficult one to position multiple things
   with the same gap and postions. To control the hieght attribute is what I learnt in this project.
   It took me about nine hours to code the CSS with a few if and buts.
   This Project was tricky as I was not allowed to use flexbox. It took me 1.5 days to build it.
